## Synopsis

Need an easy way to programatically sync 2 folders in javascript? Let cs-recursive-sync do the hard-lifting for you! Simply pass in the source folder and the sync folder as parameters and our algorithm will do the rest.

## Quick Start

To begin, clone the project into a folder of your choosing. Copy the sync.js file into your own project and create a reference to it. Finally, call syncDirectories(source, destination); syncDirectories returns a promise.
Coming Soon: Ability to require as a Node JS dependency.
